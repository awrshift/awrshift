# Hey, I'm Serhii

Odesa → Cyprus · Non-developer exploring AI agent territory

I don't write code. I explore with AI agents and see what's possible. The ideas find me on the way — most of what I've built, I couldn't have imagined before starting.

Business background. Zero CS degree. Terminal was scary once. Now it's home.

## Current Explorations

- 🔍 **[Glyte](https://github.com/awrshift1/glyte)** — open-source analytics that explains itself. Upload CSV — get instant charts, AI chat, multi-table linking, and MCP server
- ✏️ **Avoid Content** — AI content platform that tracks how visible your brand is in ChatGPT, Google AI, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini — then creates content that makes AI cite you. From "nobody sees us" to published, fact-checked articles in one workflow. I explored and validated the entire product with Claude Code, then handed it to the dev team to build *(coming soon)*
- 🧭 **AI Problem-Solving Framework** — [how I think with AI](https://github.com/awrshift1/awrshift), packaged as a file you can give to any assistant
- 📖 **The Book** — field notes from a non-developer building real things with AI agents *(coming soon)*

## How I Work

One year of daily Claude Code sessions. From terminal-scared to building production systems — as a non-developer. The level of what's possible still blows my mind. I evolve with my projects, and this path is open to anyone willing to explore.

I explore → validate ideas → build working prototypes → document everything → hand off to developers. The developers get validated ideas with working code and full documentation. No guessing, no wasted sprints.

## What I Care About

- **AI as a partner, not a tool** — the difference between asking and exploring together
- **Frameworks over prompts** — systems that make AI think before acting
- **Bridge for non-developers** — if I can build production systems, so can you
